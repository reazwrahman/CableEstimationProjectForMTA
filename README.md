# CableEstimationProjectForMTA
This project was a part of my summer internship with TC Electric LLC, a NYC based construction company. This project is intended to process raw data on cable and wire quantity needed for seven MTA stations' elevator construction project. This repository includes user interface programs, automated graphing and pdf report generation mechanism.
